## ## A little bit about me
> I started using Linux when I was nine years old, using a Raspberry Pi that my dad bought for me. I started to program with the help of a single book (https://www.cs.unca.edu/~bruce/Fall14/360/RPiUsersGuide.pdf), and nothing else. Fast forward 7 years, and I am now a developer on many popular Free and Open Source projects, and have developed many skills pertaining to system administration.
