## ## A little bit about me
> I started using Linux when I was nine years old, using a Raspberry Pi that my dad bought for me. I started to program with the help of a single book (https://www.cs.unca.edu/~bruce/Fall14/360/RPiUsersGuide.pdf), and nothing else. Fast forward 6 years, and I am now a developer on many popular Free and Open Source projects, and have developed many skills pertaining to system administration.

### ### Here are some projects that I am working on

* **Pacstall** ~ _The AUR for Ubuntu_
	- Pacstall is the AUR Ubuntu wishes it had. It takes the concept of AUR and puts a spin on it, making it easier to install programs without scouring github repos and the likes.
		- Current role: Creator/Team Leader/Developer
	- [https://pacstall.dev](https://pacstall.dev)

* **Rolling Rhino Remix** ~ _Ubuntu finally got Rolling_
	- Rolling Rhino Remix is an unofficial Ubuntu flavour which converts the Ubuntu operating system into a rolling release Linux distribution by tracking the devel series.
		- Current role: Deputy Project Leader/Developer
